This program is all about counting, and it demonstrates a few different ways to do it. 

Here’s how it breaks down:

Counting Up to 50: It starts by counting up from 0 to 50. You’ll see each number printed out one by one as it goes through the range.

Countdown from 50: After reaching 50, the program switches gears and counts down from 50 to 0, printing each number along the way.

Count Up from 30 to 50: Next, it counts up again, but this time from 30 all the way to 50, displaying each number in that range.

Countdown from 50 to 10: Then, it performs another countdown, starting at 50 and going down to 10, but it skips every other number by counting down by 2s.

Counting Up from 100 to 200: Finally, the program counts up from 100 to 200, but this time it increments by 5s, so you’ll see the numbers 100, 105, 110, and so on.
